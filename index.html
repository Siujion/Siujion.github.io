			<h3>About me</h3> 
			<p>  I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Geographical Information 
			System at the University of Leeds under the UK's Chevening Program. I am interested in geodemographics, the applications 
			of GIS in studying human health and Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) approaches in community development.
			I have 5 years experience working with QGIS and ArcGIS and a beginner in Python programming. 
			This is the first website I've ever created from scratch!

			<h3 class="centeralign">Python programming - My experience as a beginner</h3>

			<p>As part of my MSC core modules at the University of Leeds, I learned the basics of programming using Python. Learning programming has been very challenging 
			given that I have no background in Information Systems or Programming. However, I have come to understand some of the basics where
			I've learned how to write, debug and run a code for Agent Based Modelling. 
			
			The first model that I created is an animation of how invasive Crazy Yellow Ants inhabit and destroy an ecosystem and how a slight
			temperature change can kill them. The codes create an environment using pixel values of raster data, it also creates agents which 
			represent the ants, their behaviour (move and eat) and a graphic user interface. The source code for the model named - <b> Crazy Yellow Ants Invasion,</b> The source code can be found 
			can be found <!--the code for link download below was altered from that on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_download_link.asp-->
